{"name":"Qrcomparator","tagline":"","body":"qrComparator\r\n============\r\n\r\n### Project Description\r\nThis project uses a modified [larsung.de's jQuery.qrcode-0.8.0.js](http://larsjung.de/qrcode/) as the QR Code generator in conjunction with [LazarSoft's jsqrcode](https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode) to decode QR codes. The purpose of this project is to display visual differences between the original QR code and a modified QR code, and will attempt to visually depict a variety of attacks on QR codes. For layout purposes, this page is formatted with [Twitter BootStrap](getbootstrap.com/) and aimed to be mobile-responsive.\r\n\r\n### Changelog (Ordered Newest to Oldest)\r\n* **2014.07.30**\r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to draw on the canvas while the mouse is over.\r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to record and append to '#attackLog' the indicies affected.\r\n  * Modified index.html's sidebar formatting.\r\n  * Added to index.html a collapsable 'Indicies Log' that records the indicies on the pixel module of those attacked and inverted.\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js CanvasController's targetColor method.\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js with resize methods that changes the brush upon window resize.\r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to simulate the manual defacement attack on the '#modifiable' canvas. Change needs to eventually reflect on the '#differences' canvas.\r\n  * Added to index.html's #attackMode selection the option 'Manual Defacement Attack' to deface a QR code by mouse without any specific target to pixel modules. The color selection option is applicable in this attack and the brush size input slider has been added as well to dynamically change the size of the brush. \r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to simulate an automatic attack on only the specified color in correspondence to the 'Automated Single-Color Attack'\r\n  * Added to index.html's #attackMode selection the option 'Automated Single-Color Attack' to target a single color, either black or white, to simulate a defacing scenario where an attacker may deface a QR code in public with only one tool. The color selection option has been made available in the two colors.\r\n* **2014.07.29**\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js with reset methods to simply reset the existing, necessary objects instead of consuming space and creating new objects.\r\n  * Modified index.html to remove the checkbox '#showGrid.'\r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to simulate an automatic attack (while successfully showing changes made in those attacks thanks to setTimeout and window.clearTimeout ) without a specific target. Implementation showed intense lag after the first attack simulation.\r\n* **2014.07.28**\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js to come before /js/uiScript.js, with /js/modifiableScript.js being the library and /js/modifiableScript.js being the handler.\r\n  * Modified index.html to include the checkbox '#showGrid' to easier differenciate changes.\r\n  * Modified /js/uiScript.js to have a global listener to thrown errors from LazarSoft and alert the user whether the decoding procedure was successful or if an error is thrown.\r\n  * Added to /js/modifiableScript.js to be object-oriented with a hardcoded CanvasController to control the three canvases, 'original,' 'modifiable,' and 'differences', while also displaying the needed module differences on 'differences' canvas. The yellow is to signify a change from the original's black to white. The red signifies a change from the original's white to black.\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js's CanvasObject to individually handle getters and setters based in index and mouse coordinates, specifically for inverting the color on that canvas, getting the index and mouse position, and the respective hexcolor values.\r\n* **2014.07.25**\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js to work with QR code given the identifier of the canvas element's parent (#original, #modifiable, #differences).\r\n  * Modified /js/modifiableScript.js #modifiable's QR code to receive hexvalue from mouse position and invert the color of that specific pixel module on #modifiable's QR code.\r\n* **2014.07.24**\r\n  * Modified [jsqrcode](https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode)'s qrcode.js on lines 32 to 40 to alternatively accept a canvas element to decode.\r\n  * Modified [jQuery.qrcode](http://larsjung.de/qrcode/) on lines 57, 58 to update the Version numbers in index.html upon generation.\r\n  * Modified [jsqrcode](https://github.com/LazarSoft/jsqrcode)'s decoder.js on line 61 to update the Version number for #modifiable's QR Code in index.html.\r\n  * Added convertCanvasToImage.php to accept a data URL and over qrcode.png to be decoded in uiScript.js upon #decodeQR button click.\r\n  * Added /js/modifiableScript.js that will handle the drawing in #modifiable's QR code.\r\n  * Added /js/uiScript.js to handle index.html's field input changes and mobile responsiveness.\r\n\r\n### To Be Implemented (Order of Importance)\r\n* Make the differences in the defacement attack reflect on the '#differences' canvas and to be it with mousedown and mouseover.\r\n* Implement different simulated attacks on QR codes, beginning with attack on code words now that manual blind-attacks are implemented.\r\n* Make top two QR codes mobile responsive upon browser window change.\r\n* Make sidebar togglable and visible in mobile browser view.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
